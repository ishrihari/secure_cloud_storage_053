The Secure Cloud Storage & Backup Management System project focuses on designing a reliable and secure cloud-based solution to protect organizational data from accidental deletion, disk failures, and unauthorized access. The project addresses a real-world problem where critical internal documents were lost due to the absence of a proper backup policy, retention strategy, and centralized access control. To overcome this issue, the system implements a structured cloud storage architecture that ensures data availability, security, and recoverability.
The solution uses cloud object storage to store business files in dedicated storage buckets. Versioning is enabled to maintain multiple copies of files, preventing permanent loss even if data is accidentally deleted. Snapshots and backups act as recovery checkpoints, allowing administrators to restore previous versions quickly. This significantly improves business continuity and reduces downtime during failures.
Security is a key component of the system. Encryption at rest protects stored data from unauthorized access, while encryption in transit secures data during transmission using secure protocols. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is implemented using Identity and Access Management (IAM), where administrators have full control and regular users are granted limited permissions based on the principle of least privilege. This ensures controlled access and accountability.
The system also considers performance factors such as IOPS and throughput to optimize storage efficiency. Backup retention policies ensure that historical versions of files are preserved for a defined period, supporting compliance and disaster recovery requirements.
Overall, this project demonstrates how cloud technology can provide scalable, secure, and highly durable storage with effective backup and recovery mechanisms, ensuring long-term data protection and operational reliability for organizations.
